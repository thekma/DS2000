# Problem 2: Wranging Regions
# Name:

# Introduction: The data gathered here tells us universities, their region, their starting salary
# and their final salary. The overall goal of this practicum is to import this data,
# clean the data, put it in a useful form to do calculations, and then display it

# It is an important issue to consider where your data is coming from: for sake of
# this example, you can assume the data is reasonable and ethical (though you should be careful about assuming that in the future)

# Instructions:
# Your instructions are as follows:
# 1.) Import data from regiondata.txt using the "open" function

# 2.) "Clean" the data and make it usable. This will require a little bit of manuvering, because
# "splitting" the data splits by spaces, so it will treat
# "Northeastern University" as "Northeastern" and "University"

# 3.) Sort the data according to REGION. For each region, find the following:

    # a.) Find the percent change between starting and ending salary and store that information
    # Reminder: percentChange = (ending-starting)/starting * 100

    # b.) Display what the maximum percent change is, along with the school that it corresponds to

    # c.) Display what the minimum percent change is, along with the school that it corresponds to

    # d.) Use the statistics module to find the mean and standard deviation
    # Display this data

# 4.) There are, of course, a lot of factors beyond just mean and standard deviation,
# but based SOLEY on these, make a conclusion about which region would earn you the
# highest salary. (Example: this complete ignores cost of living, which will play a huge role in salary)
